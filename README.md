## Short Summary

My choice of techonologies used for this task:
- React.js
- Sass

Reason behind my choices is because I like to work with React.js and I have not had chance to
work with React for a while so I took this opportunity to work with it and learn a couple of
new things. :)

The project architecture - Nothing too fancy. I tried to make separate components and components
that can be easily reused later in code if needed. I tried to not make too long class components
so I tried to split them up where it made sense.

That being said, There's a lot of room for improvement. As I chose to use components with rendering
logic and bussiness logic in one file, this could be split up to make the code more readable
and more pleasant to work with.

Also Could improve on styling, since I currently hard-coded colors and did not use variable file
to define all variables and reuse them in .scss files later.
